        <h1> <b>How the Pandemic affected the PC market!</b></h1>
      </div>
      <hr>
      <p style="font-size: 17px">Electronics have become an increasingly regular part of our lives. We carry our phones around in our pockets, cars are becoming increasingly electronically complex, and smarthomes and devices like Alexa are becoming more prominent than ever.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 17px">Aside from all this many jobs require computers either for communication or as part of the labor itself. Electronic media and entertainment have become more mainstream with video streaming sites like Netflix, Twitch and Youtube having become increasingly popular over the past decade. Not only that but video games have begun to become one of the dominant forms of entertainment.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 17px">So let's look at the history of how COVID-19 exacerbated this focus on technology in our lives.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 17px">When the pandemic started, it forced a number of immediate changes to how we lived our lives. Many were forced into remote learning and work environments, and this led to two big changes in particular</p>
                <p style="font-size: 17px">Firstly, there was an increased need for laptops and computers in general, as transitioning to remote work and school meant those who previously didn't need personal computers now needed them. This led to an increase in sales for computers that had not been seen in a decade. 
                    According to resaearch firm IDC, there was an annual increase in PC shipments around 13.1%, which is the highest since 2010's 13.7% increase.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 17px"> Not only that, but due to many stores being closed and people forced to live indoors, ecommerce in general became much more popular. According to the Annual Retail Trade Survey (ARTS), e-commerce sales increased by $244.2 billion or 43% in 2020.
                However, this increase in demand for electronics and the general increease in digital commerce led to a serious issue: shipping issues and shortages!</p>

            <div class="eside">
                <p style="font-size: 17px">The unprecedented level of danger presented by the COVID-19 pandemic led to new safety precautions with regards to ports and shipping. Ports became bottlenecks where cargo was unable to be loaded and unloaded in a timely manner, espeically when it came to high traffic trade ports between the U.S. and Asia. This was exacerbated by ecommerce often dealing with overseas shipping.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 17px">However, shipping by sea wasn't the only issue, as it turns out, air cargo was also deeply affected. Accorind the the Department of Homeland Security, passenger aircraft represents approximately 25 percent of all domestic air cargo transported, as around half of the goods in the holds of passenger planes are air cargo.
                This presented a problem for air shipping as in 2020, "annual global passenger air travel volume decreased by nearly two-thirds" according to the CDC.</p>

            <div class="eside">
                <p style="font-size: 17px">Besides the issues of shipping, the pandemic also affected multiple industries by creating a chip shortage.
                <br><br>Semiconductor manufacturing is a tricky beast, as it is not particularly flexible. To properly manufacture semiconductors, several steps require cleanroom facilities with extremely low particle counts. Not only that but they can cost $10-$20 billion and take 3-5 years to complete, which means increasing output is difficult.
                <br><br>Not only that, but it tends to be sensitive to shifts in supply or demand due to the fact that historically, the industry uses "Just in Time" (JiT) manufacturing. With JiT manufacturing, you create just enough supply to meet demand, with very little or no extra stock. This can also apply to keeping very little supply of matierals on hand, not just finished product.
                <br><br>Semiconductors have been becoming more and more required as the need for both high-end and low-end chips are required for AI, Machine Learning, cryptocurrency, and increasingly complex systems in cars. These factors meant that when the pandemic increased demand on electronics and disrupted supply lines, the industry couldn't keep up. This led to a shortage lasting a few years.

            <h1>Research/Time Use Data</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 17px">Here we have a highlight of some of the main findings I've found in my research into the amount of time people spend on gaming and the amount of people who game!</p>
            <p style="font-size: 17px">The Data itself is taken from the American Time Use Survey. I filtered by the subcategory of games/activities played for leisure, which includes computer gaming (there was no specific category for console or mobile gaming). That being said, most of the other listed leisure activities that are not playing computer games are things like playing poker or crosswords, which are unlikely to change over time like cimputer games have over the past two decades.
                <br><br> The data was compiled with MySQL and the visualizations of my data were made with Python's matplotlib and pyplot libraries. These are not all the visualizations and data, just ones that show the most distinct patterns.</p>

            <h2>Gaming by Age</h2>
            <hr>
            <div class="eside">

            </div>
            <div class="eside">
                <p style="font-size: 20px">For our first set of data, we have a visualization of the percentage of people who could be categorized as gamers (someone who was recorded playing a game). This is per year from 2003-2022 and counts a variety of age groups. The categories are divided into:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Less than 15</li>
                    <li>15-24</li>
                    <li>25-34</li>
                    <li>35-44</li>
                    <li>45-54</li>
                    <li>55-64</li>
                    <li>Over 65</li>
                </ul>
                <p style="font-size: 20px">From this first visual we can see that most age groups have had at minimum a slow upward trend in the percentage of people playing games. Among all the age groups, we can see that ages 15-24, 25-34 and 65+ are all the highest in terms of percentage by 2022.
                <br><br>We can see that the younger groups have been the fastest increasing group when it comes to gaming, but that 65+ seems to have been high consistently (possibly due to the leisure activity category being a bit broad and/or older people having more time for leisure activities).
                 Another thing to notice is that the youngest of the three top groups  all had a large increase in 2020 from 2019, which means more people ages 15-34 were recorded playing games.<br><br></p>
                <hr>
                <p style="font-size: 20px"><br>Our second visual is the overall percentages of people recorded playing games. The age category labels 1-7 represent the ordered ages listed above. As we can see, the highest percentages go to the same three listed above, with 65+ in the lead, and 15-24 in second. Ages 25-34 is third From this we can conclude like above that ages 65+ spend the most time with leisure, and that younger people tend to play more than other age groups besides 65+.
                <br><br>That being said, the increase in gaming activityes increasing for ages 15-34 is likely due to the increasing adoption of video games, as it's unlikely that anyone is playing more bingo or poker than they were 10 or 20 years ago.

            <h2>Gaming By Sex and Year</h2>

            <div class="eside">
                <img src="\assets\imgs\visualizations\Percent_SexYear.png" alt="com" width="450" height="450">

            </div>
            <div class="eside">
                <p style="font-size: 20px">When it comes to comparing people playing games by sex over time, trends in the data tend to be less dramatic than by age group. That being said, there are still some things we can notice. 
                <br><br>Our first visual takes into account trends in percentages of men and women playing games over time. As we can see, men and women tend to have similar trends over time, with main difference being that there are more male gamers more than female gamers. Both sexes have seen a rise in gamers over the past 10 years in particular
                <br><br>However, if we look at the sequence of years from 2019-2020 we see an interesting contrast. For both men and women in 2020, there was an increase in gamers, but the proportion between them is different. Men seemed to increase in the amount gamers more than women did.
                <br><br><hr><br>
                We can see a similar trend in our second visual, which shows the total amount of time spent (in minutes) on gaming per 100 gamers. Again men and women have simliar trends with men spending more time gaming overall. 
                <br><br>The big difference can be seen from the sequence of years from 2018-2020. Both men and women increase in playtime in 2018, sharply dropped off in 2019, and jumped back up in 2020. The big difference is the 2020 jump. In 2020, men's playtime spiked back up above the amounts seen in 2018, where women spiked up, but were less than the numbers from 2018.
                <br><br>It seems that in 2020 the normal gap in game playing between the sexes increased in the favor of men. A possible explanation may be that women were forced to do more childcare during the pandemic, so that even though lockdown decreased time spent at work, ladies did not get the same level of increased fun time as dudes.

            <hr>            
            <p style="font-size: 20px">Despite all the issues with the semiductor shortage and shipping issues, the increased need for electronics and increased leisure time created the perfect storm for electronics. 
            Even after the initial stages of the pandemic have subsided, our lives are still more digital than they were before. Despite many companies pushing for a return to the office, many hybrid and remote positions still exist,
             and the use of digital communication software like zoom is still prevalent. While the initial set of circumstsances (increased free time and lockdowns) have dissipated, many fo the changes to how our society deals with work and leisure have forever been impacted by COVID-19.
