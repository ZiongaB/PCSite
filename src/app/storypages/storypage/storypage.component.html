      <p style="font-size: 17px">Electronics have become an increasingly regular part of our lives. We carry our phones around in our pockets, cars are becoming increasingly electronically complex, and smarthomes and devices like Alexa are becoming more prominent than ever.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 17px">Aside from all this many jobs require computers either for communication or as part of the labor itself. Electronic media and entertainment have become more mainstream with video streaming sites like Netflix, Twitch and Youtube having become increasingly popular over the past decade. Not only that but video games have begun to become one of the dominant forms of entertainment.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 17px">So let's look at the history of how COVID-19 exacerbated this focus on technology in our lives.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 17px">Here we have a highlight of some of the main findings I've found in my research into the amount of time people spend on gaming and the amount of people who game!</p>
            <p style="font-size: 17px">The Data itself is taken from the American Time Use Survey. I filtered by the category of activites doine for leisure that includes computer gaming (there was no specific category for console or mobile gaming).</p>
