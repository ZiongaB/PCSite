      <hr>
      <p style="font-size: 17px">When it comes to building a PC, there are a lot of potential resources, but they all depend on your needs. You need to consider the level of power you need, space requirements, portability, and most of all budget.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 17px">While individual software needs will vary, if you're using your computer for graphically intesive things like video editing, 3d animation, machine learning, or video games you will need to plan your build with power in mind.</p> 
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 17px">Below are some advice and tools with the assuming you're going for a powerful PC with gaming in mind. A dediccated gaming PC will usually be powerful enough to deal with other intensive activities.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 20px"><b>PC specs planning:</b>
                <br><br>When going for a PC that can handle PC gaming, you need to consider what kind of games you're looking to play. Are you planning on playing the most modern, graphically advanced games on the highest settings? Are you looking to play less intensive retro or indie games? Whatever the case there are different startegies to determine your required hardware specs.
                <br><br>For most modern games, the best place for getting PC games is Steam. Steam is an online games distribution platform that has been around since 2003. One of its features is that games usually have a listed minimum and recommended hardware specifications for any game you come across. This may not always be specific enough, so looking at forum or social media posts about the general requirements for said games can be useful.
                <br><br>After deciding your budget and needs, all other choices stem from your choice of parts. CPU, GPU, RAM, storage space, and features are probably the most important parts, so pick all your other parts according. 
                <br><br><hr><br><b>Picking Parks:</b>
                <br><br>Once you have an idea of specs, you will want to find parts that match those specs. One of the best tools for this is <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com">PCPartPicker.com</a>. This website is one of the most useful sources for building a PC on the web. Its main sections are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Builder:</b> Allows the user to create a list of parts for their PC build. It keeps track of electricity needed, part compatibility, and price for the build.</li>
                    <li><b>Product:</b> Allows the user to search for parts based on features, power, price, and even manufacturer.</li>
                    <li><b>Guides:</b> Shows the user a set of preselected pc build guides based on intended use, power, and price.</li>
                    <li><b>Completed Builds:</b> Allows users to see builds other users have made along with images.</li>
                    <li><b>Trends:</b> A section that shows the general price history of PC parts over time</li>

                </ul>
                <p style="font-size: 20px">
                Again this website contains just about everything you need. Ratings, reviews, prices, and various potential places to buy it from online for each part. This site is so thourough that you'll probably need very little else.
