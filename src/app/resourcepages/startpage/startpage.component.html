      <p style="font-size: 17px">Getting a new computer can be a complicated process when you don't know what you need! Getting the wrong computer for your needs can be expensive and frustrating.</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 17px">Besides cost there are a lot of factors to consider. What will you be using it for primarily? What level of power do you want? Do you need to take it on the go? Do you want to be able to modify or upgrade it?</p>
      <br>
      <p style="font-size: 17px">Below we provide some information to help answer some of these questions.</p>

                <h2>Desktops</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 17px">Tower-based desktop computers, despite becoming less popular compared to laptops, are still often what people would think of when asked to envision the word "computer".</p>
                <br>These computers have all of the computing hardware held within the tower (a self contained case) that plugs into a separate monitor/tv and keyboard in order to function. 
                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Performance:</b> The size and design of a tower PC is conducive to having the most modern and powerful hardware you can afford.</li>
                    <li><b>Upgrading:</b> Due to the large, modular nature of desktop PCs and their parts, allow for easy upgrading and replacing of single parts.</li>
                    <li><b>Cost:</b> Because desktops are modular, they are easier to repair/replace parts for, saving you money.</li>
                    <li><b>Customization:</b> Peripherals and your computer's setup are lot easier to customize when everything isn't all in one piece.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Space requirements:</b> Because of their larger size compared to laptops, desktops tend to require more space.</li>
                    <li><b>Portability:</b> Transporting a large pc tower around is impractical, meaning it's better suited for staying in one place. </li>
                    <li><b>Peripherals:</b> Desktops don't always come with monitors, keyboards, mice, or other peripherals, which must be bought separately.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr><br><br><h2>Laptops</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 17px"> Laptops computers are probably the more common form of computer used by the average person nowadays. Their portable nature makes them less customizable, but more versatile in when and where they're used.</p>

                </ul>
                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cost:</b> The cost of being a portable all-in-one computer means for comparable desktops, laptops tend to be more expensive.</li>
                    <li><b>Upgrading:</b> Laptops generally have little to no room for upgrades or to replace specific parts that a desktop normally allows.</li>
                    <li><b>Performance:</b> Due to their limited size and design specifications, laptops have more limited power and performance compared to desktops.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr><br><br><h2>All-in-one Desktop</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 17px">A category of computer that combines aspects of desktop and laptop design to create something more streamlined than a desktop, but not as portable as a laptop.</p>
                <h3>Pros:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Form Factor:</b> All-in-one desktops tend to be more compact, clean, and with fewer cables than your average desktop PC.</li>
                    <li><b>Transportation</b> It's easier to transport a single device instead of a desktop PC tower, monitor, and peripherals.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Cons:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cost:</b> Much like laptops, a machine designed be all-in-one tends to cost more than the equivalent custom-built desktops.</li>
                    <li><b>Power:</b> Due to the more compact nature of all-in-ones, they tend to have less power than similar desktops.</li>
                    <li><b>Lack of Modification</b> Similar to laptops, they tend to be much harder to repair, and replacing parts tends to not be an option.</li>
