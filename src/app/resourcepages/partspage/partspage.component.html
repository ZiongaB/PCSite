                    <b>Motherboard:</b>
                    <br> The motherboard is the main circuit board that holds and connects the computational and electrical parts of the computer (CPU, GPU, RAM, etc.). 
                    <br><br>The size, shape, and compatibility of the motherboard plays a huge part building a computer, so research is important. Does it have built in Wifi or ethernet? How many ports does it have and what kind? Keep these in mind when choosing.
                    <br><br><hr><b>Computer Processing Unit (CPU):</b>
                    <br>The CPU is the brain of the computer. It does much of the processing of tasks, and is necessary for a computer to function.
                    <br><br>It's choosing a CPU with the proper speed, amount of cores, and compatibilty with other parts is another one of the more important parts of building a PC.
                    <br><br><hr><b>Graphical Processing Unit (GPU):</b>
                    <br>The GPU is a device that processes computer graphics and video. This is important for graphically or computationally intensive tasks like video editing, playing video games, and machine learning. 
                    <br><br>Many CPUs come with integrated GPUs, but having a dedicated GPU is helpful if you intend to have a powerful device.
                    <br><br><hr><b>Storage (HDD and SSD):</b>
                    <br>Storage is probably one of the more easy to understand parts. Hard Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD) are the storage that contains all the files and programs on the computer.
                    <br><br>The speed and size of the drive is important to consider, even when not building your own PC. SSDs tend to be faster and are becoming more and more common than HDDs.
                    <br><br><hr><b>Random Access Memory (RAM):</b>
                    <br>RAM is the short term memory storage for the computer. It is often used by programs to store data while a program is running, meaning that the amount of RAM you have determines how well high end programs run.
                    <br><br>RAM comes in different sizes and speeds, and there are often slots for multiple sticks of RAM on a motherboard.

                    <b>Case:</b>
                    <br>The case is the main shell of the PC tower. The size and design of the case determines what components can fit in your PC.
                    <br><br>Choosing a case defines the type of motherboard, power, ports, and cooling system your PC can have, so choose wisely.
                    <br><br><hr><b>Power Supply:</b>
                    <br>Power supply is pretty self explanatory. The power supply is the device that supplies power to the computer.
                    <br><br>You should be aware of the level of power your computer needs and choose accordingly. That being said, power supply and the case you choose are linked, so you should keep their compatibilty in mind.
                    <br><br><hr><b>Cooling System:</b>
                    <br>Computers generate heat, and you don't want your computer to overheat! It could fry itself or catch on fire if you're not careful! There are three main types of cooling system.
                    <br><br>There's powered fans that move air in and out of the case to cool the PC (always be aware case compatibilty). There are heat sinks, a piece of metal that draws heat away from computer components it's touching. Finally there's liquid cooling systems that use water to absorb heat.

                    <b>Monitor:</b>
                    <br>The monitor is probably one of the more important peripherals, since without it, you can't see what you're doing! There are many different types of monitors that display light and color differently.
                    <br><br>Some are large, some are curved, and some people will use multiple monitors for one computer! How nice your viewing experience is for a movie or game will depend on the monitor you choose.
                    <br><br><hr><b>Keyboard:</b>
                    <br>Keyboards are pretty self-explanatory. You need one of these to do any typing on a computer. Some people get keyboards with all sorts of LED lights, but those are more expensive.
                    <br><br>Only spend as much money on a keyboard as you feel you need to.
                    <br><br><hr><b>Mouse:</b>
                    <br>The mouse is, much like the keyboard, necessary. Mice are easy to come by and can have more than just 2 buttons and a scroll wheel. 
                    <br><br>Some mice are wired, some are wireless, some glow, and some have various buttons for sensitivity!
                    <br><br><hr><b>Sound System:</b>
                    <br>While some monitors come with speakers built in, sound quality is important. Choosing the right sound setup will depend on your needs.
                    <br><br>If you do music or sound editing, or if you like watching movies and playing games in surround sound, you may want to consider buying a more expensive sound system.
